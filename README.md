# Task One

The processArray function iterates through an array of numbers. It squares each even number and triples each odd number, then returns a new array with these processed values.  
Input: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Output: [16, 15, 36, 21, 64]
The number 4 is even, so it is squared (4*4 = 16).
The number 5 is odd, so it is tripled (5*3 = 15).
The number 6 is even, so it is squared (6*6 = 36).
The number 7 is odd, so it is tripled (7*3 = 21).
The number 8 is even, so it is squared (8 * 8 = 64).
